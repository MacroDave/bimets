Estimating the RBA MARTIN model in R using the bimets package.

There are two version of the model (and accompanying R script). The ones without the _EST_ postscript the behavioural equations are not estimated, the parameter values are imposed and each equation is included as an identity. The ones with _EST_ the behavioural equations are written out and estimated.

For now the data is just loaded in manually as a looooong list. 

There are also lots of other things I have probably done the long way because I am awful at R. If you see something done badly and now a better/faster/more efficient way please edit them for me!
